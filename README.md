# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Is the systematic appliaction methods and tools to the development and maintenance of systems

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?Software engineering is a disciplines approach to developing software involving systematic methods while traditional program refers to the act of writing code to solve specific problemswithout necessarily foloowing a structured approach
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Is a structurd process that outlines the steps involvd in creating software

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requiremsnts Gathering Understanding and documenting the needs of stakehlders and users
Analysis Analyzing the requiremsnts to determine the softwares functionality and constraints
Design Creating s bueprint for the software arctitecture, including data structures 
Testing Verifying that the softwar behaves as expected and meets the requirements
Depoloyment INtroducing the software into the production environment for actual use
Maintenance Making updates fixing bugs and enhancing the software to ensure its continued usefullness and reliability 
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile model uses the sequestial approacg while the waterfall modelis iteartive and incremental approachwith shorter development stages 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall model and Agile models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
 Waterfall Model Each phase must be completed before moving tothe next. Emphasizes extensive upfront planning and documentation. Sited for projects with well defined requirements and stable environment
Agile model Ptipotizes flexibility collaborationn and customer fedback. Allows fr continous refinement of rewuiements. Suited fot projects where requirements may eveolve, and rapid delivery is essential
Requirements Engineering:
is the process of eliciting analyzing and documenting and managing the requirements of a software system.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
